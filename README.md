# Grocery-Chain-Dashboard

For this project, I worked data from Maven Market, a multinational grocery chain with establishments in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. I executed the end-to-end business intelligence workflow including tasks such as data connection and shaping, constructing a relational model, integrating calculated fields, and designing an interactive report.
